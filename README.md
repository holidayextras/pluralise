# pluralise
Pluralise our product names

We have a need to pluralise product names in a strange way at times, this repo covers those rules.

## Usage
```javascript
  pluralise.plural('sheep') # returns 'sheep'
```

## Test
```
  npm test
```

## Lint
uses https://github.com/holidayextras/make-up
```
  npm run lint
```

## Coverage
expects 100% coverage (shouldn't be too hard)
```
  npm run coverage
```
